Here I wanted to collect various websites that contain resources for data science and programming. I've been asked everything under the sun in interviews, and wanted to create a reference page that is a one-stop-shop for any data science-related issues.

### Ensemble Methods

<a href="https://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/what-is-the-fundamental-difference-between-randomforest-and-gradient-boosting-algorithms/2341/3" target="_blank">Random Forest vs. Gradient Boosting</a> - The two videos at the bottom of this post (via Udacity) explain both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting alogorithms work. This is the clearest explanation of the two I've come across.

### Case Studies

<a href="http://blog.yhat.com/posts/predicting-customer-churn-with-sklearn.html" target="_blank">Predicting Customer Churn With Sci-Kit Learn</a> - This is incredibly helpful blog post that addresses a churn problem in many steps. First it builds a classification model that optimizes accuracy for a churn dataset. Then it moves to recall. Then it moves to looking at churn probability rather than a binary classification and combines the probability with each customer's value so that it can calculate an expected loss. Finally it moves to production level code that spits out a CSV file of results. Great post, with all of the code included.
