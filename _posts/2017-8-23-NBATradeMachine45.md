title: Custom NBA Trade Machine Part Four and a Half

I don't have time to do a full post today, but I wanted to take some time to do some brainstorming.

Specifically I want to brainstorm edge cases for my program thusfar.

To recap, I have a command-line program set up that lets the user input trade suggestions for up to four teams at a time.

So how can I break it?

1) Remove all the players from a trade.
2) Add the same player to a trade multiple times (with multiple destinations?)
3) Try and trade entire team rosters with each other.
4) Do a trade where I trade several small-contract players for one large-contract player.
5) Push the limits of the machine. 5-team trade? 10-team trade? 30-team trade?
6) What if I made a program to try and push through every single trade possible and posted results? How many combinations are out there?

These are just a few examples, but hopefully they'll help me think about the program as I continue to develop it, both in de-bugging it and evaluating what's possible, realistic and useful for it.

(P.S.: LOL at my Kyrie trade proposal going up the day he gets traded...)
