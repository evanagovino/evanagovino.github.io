title: On Sam Harris and Charles Murray
---

This is a blog nominally about data science, and this is a post nominally about data science. I swear.

Back on April 22nd, Sam Harris had Charles Murray on his *Waking Up* podcast. Harris is a neuroscientist and author who has written several books about athiesm and spirtuality. More recently, he has delved into politics. His political stance is to the left on many matters, except on the topic of Islam and Islamic terrorism, where he is firmly to the right (in this sense he is like his late contemporary Christopher Hitchens).

I'm not sure when I started listening to his podcast, but a genuine interest in his stance (ostensibly the promotion of science, morality, reason and secularlism) has morphed into hate-listening. This timeline has coincided with the total meltdown of the American political dialogue in the past two years. If I had to pinpoint exactly when I started getting frustrated, it was probably when a man who just turned 50 used the term 'social justice warrior' unironically.

Harris is now in the political cluster of pundits like Andrew Sullivan and Jonathan Chait. Something like a neoliberal (bad) who hates the Clinton family (good!) and hates Donald Trump (great!) but hates him more for violating public civility rather than being a total con-artist. I've held a pretty firm stance of 'the enemy of my enemy is not my friend' in the Trump era and feel justified in doing so when 'The Resistance' gives creedence to people along the lines of Bush acolyte David Frum.

But anyway - so yeah, Harris has a podcast that I still listen to occasionally for some reason. The other week, Harris had Charles Murray on in an episode called 'Forbidden Knowledge'. Murray is the author of the book *The Bell Curve* from the early 90s. *The Bell Curve* was a book about whether intelligence was derived from nature or nurture, and was particularly controversial for claiming that white people had a higher mean IQ than black people. Murray has been in the news lately because people have been protesting and disrupting his speeches.

On the face of it, if this were all you knew, you could etch out a reason for this conversation to exist. Harris believes in free speech, and wants to look past the bounds of political correctness. If Murray has legitimate findings, Harris wants to give him a platform to speak. He is unafraid to have him on his podcast because believes in reason above all else.

Unfortunately for Harris, Murray, and everyone who listened to the conversation, Murray's findings are completely illegitimate. [This article][1] from The New York Review of Books pretty thoroughly debunked the studies cited in *The Bell Curve*. In short: many of the scholars and journals cited in *The Bell Curve* received grants from The Pioneer Fund, a non-profit devoted to 'race betterment' founded by literal Nazi sympathizers with an interest in eugenics. Many of the studies cited in the book were done by Richard Lynn, who was thanked by Murray for his advice as a 'leading shcolar of racial and ethnic differences'.

Lynn's findings about racial IQ were plagued by awful design. As an example: he claimed that the mean IQ of Africans was 70. He found this through a 1989 study in South Africa that showed 1,093 sixteen-year old black students scoring a mean of 69 on the South African Junior Aptitude test. This single study was used to determine IQ for all blacks in Africa. Furthermore, the author of the study blamed the low scores on poor schooling conditions for blacks under apartheid as well as their difficulty with English. He even said that the results could not be taken as an indication of the intelligence of Africans.

Another claim of Lynn's was that the Japanese had a mean IQ 10 points higher than European whites. This was found by comparing a screened Japanese sample of children from well-off parents to an unscreened sample of European children. Yet another study compared 178 unscreened Japanese children in 1985 to 64,000 screened American children in 1972 to 10,000 screened British children in 1978. 

Seemingly numbers nor time didn't get in the way of his conclusion.

In summation, *The Bell Curve* cited studies with bad design from sources that had funding from pro-eugenics group. If anyone is still looking to defend the book or its claims, I'm all ears.

The worst part is that this article was written nearly *a quarter-century ago*. Murray was raked through the coals so long ago that an entire generation isn't privy to the nature of the controversy. Seen through the lens of 'free speech', 'political correctness' and 'social justice warriors', it's easy to miss exactly why people derided *The Bell Curve* so much.

And that's why the onus lies on Sam Harris to, oh I don't know, do some fucking research. Does he really believe in the virtue of reason? Or does he believe in the trope of letting everyone talk civilly at the cost of the actual truth?

Go look at Sam Harris' [subreddit] [2]. There are dozens or even hundreds of users who are now hawking faulty race-science and genuinely believe that black people have lower IQs than white people.
